Homework2 - Portfolio Summary

This project is focused on building a portfolio site that will be continuously updated throughout the bootcamp course to present to potential employers in the future.
Note: It's currently unfinished, I will be resubmitting the entirety of the finished code by Tuesday morning as I've had repairs being done on my residence and the internet has had to be disconnected often as they finish repairs, which has set me back a bit with time as I'm still learning and need to be researching as I write my code.

The code will consist of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. It includes clickable navigation buttons that scroll within the page, clickable external links to my LinkedIn, Instagram and GitHub account, a small "About Me" summary, and a few images of my current work. Currently I have placeholder images - these will not be used for the final piece. I have a small starter stylesheet of CSS and the majority of my HTML completed and will be submitting what I have so far for current review despite not being finished with the final portfolio page.
Any comments or suggestions are welcome.
